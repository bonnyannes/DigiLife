# DigiLife
DigiLife is a simple web application that uses ethereum blockchain technology to demonstrate the automation of insurance claims processing. The project was created for the [CrytoChicks Hackathon](https://cryptochickshackathon.com/), specifically for the Juniper Life Insurance Bounty. 

Details of the Juniper hackathon project can be found [here](https://devpost.com/software/juniper-long-on-life).

### Try it out
The claims processing smart contract used by DigiLife is deployed on the Ethereum ropsten testnet only.  To interact with DigiLife, you will need an Ethereum account and some ropsten testnet ethers.  If you have [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) installed, you can access the DigiLife by accessing: https://bonnyannes.github.io/DigiLife.

If you don't have MetaMask, you can access the application [here](https://ropsten.ethers.io/#!/app-link/bonnyannes.github.io/DigiLife/) using [Ethers.io](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.io).  No need to install any plugin.

Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/sqlSQxFlmRM) on how to use Ethers.io to create an ethereum account and get free ropsten test ethers to try out DigiLife.
